**About**

This is a project about user experience and responsive screen size. I also use Figma for the first time, using the designers requests to build this site.

**Figma**

**Media**

After designing, I used the following URL and the Responsively app to test the responsiveness across multiple viewports at once. Although not a perfect solution, it quickly showed me any major broad-brushtroke issues.

**Images**

Exported images directly from Figma. Optimized images [here](https://tinypng.com/), for faster load time.
