              Still, as sparsely populated as it was in the 1600s, this is an
              extraordinary and highly underrated state full of rich history
              and majestic natural beauty. Maine is the main state you want to
              be sure not to miss. As your journey is going to be a long one,
              you had best be prepared for an arduous trek.

              Thankfully, not only is Maine home to the very first European
              settlers on US territory in the era of Vikings, but is also home
              to L.L. Bean, which is a great company to grab a super sturdy
              backpack from for your 3-month expedition.

              You won't be on your bike the whole time, so doesn't it make
              sense to pick up some extra footwear? Fortunately for you, the
              best outdoor shoe company in the history of the world proudly
              hails from this state. Cycle by the Timberland headquarters in
              Stratham, and pick up a pair of rugged, waterproof boots to keep
              your feet dry. Fitting for unpredictable weather you may be
              confronted by while passing through the Appalachians. These
              boots are also better than cycling shoes when pitching a tent.

              Not only famous for “The Big Apple,” the state of NY also has
              several other reasons for going down in history. Since the late

              has been home to the world-famous General Electric Company.

              for your bicycle to help you see through those dark lonely roads
              on your adventure. Such a light from GE will set you back about

              Erie, Pennsylvania, not to be confused with the word “eerie,”
              although it can be from time to time, is another town worth
              passing through for several different reasons. While it might be
              most famously known as the scene of the Gettysburg address
              delivered by Mr. Lincoln during the Civil war, Pennsylvania also
              has produced a rather decent-sized Amish community (eerie, huh?)

              The reason we've brought you here today, if you haven't already
              guessed, can be summed up by using one delicious word:
              chocolate. Hershey's is a Pennsylvania-based company. Most
              likely, one of the tastiest missions you'll ever embark on
              during this tour, try to find an Amish friend and enjoy a bar in
              the National Wildlife Refuge on your way to Erie and have an
              extra eerie time!

              From the college capital of Columbus to the clean coastline of
              Cleveland, Ohio is a truly hidden gem. Earthquakes are
              surprisingly common in this particular region of North America,
              over 200 of which have registered with a magnitude of 2 or
              higher since 1776. However, earthquakes aren't the only thing
              shaking this centrally located state. One of the country's
              largest and oldest roller coaster parks is waiting to ROCK your
              world in Sandusky, Ohio! This will presumably be one of the most
              thrilling quests you'll ever complete (provided you can stomach
              it). Take a much-deserved break to ride as many roller coasters
              as you can before continue your bike ride!
